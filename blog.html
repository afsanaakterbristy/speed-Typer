        <h3>1.Difference between localstorage and sessionstorage in javascript.</h3>
        <p>Ans.The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage
        data is cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser
        tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time.</p>
        <h3>2.What is difference between global scope and block scope?</h3>
        <p>Ans.The main difference between the local scope and block scope is that the block statements, don't create a new scope. So the var keyword will not have an effect, because the variables are still in the
        same scope. ES6 introduced block scope by using the let and const keywords.</p>
        <h3>3.How does javascript event loop work.</h3>
        <p>Ans.The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the
        Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such
        an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
