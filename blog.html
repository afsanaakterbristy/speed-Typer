        <h3>1.Difference between localstorage and sessionstorage in javascript.</h3>
        <p>Ans.The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage
        data is cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser
        tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time.</p>
